# Predict_the_lowest_price

**Problem:**
The primary task of this assignment is to develop a linear regression model that accurately predicts the "Low_Cap_Price" column. This column represents the minimum price at which a particular product, crafted by local artisans, can be sold. By employing linear regression, we aim to assist the e-commerce company in establishing a pricing strategy that supports local artists while providing discounts to their customers.

**Methodology:**
Our approach involves several steps. First, we will preprocess the data, handling any missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical representations if necessary. Next, we will explore the dataset through descriptive statistics and visualizations to gain insights into the relationships between the attributes and the lowest price. Feature engineering techniques, such as scaling or creating new features, may be applied to improve the model's performance.
Following the data exploration and feature engineering phase, we will split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the linear regression model, and the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance. We will assess the model's accuracy by considering evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.

**Conclusion:**
By applying linear regression, we can develop a predictive model that effectively predicts the lowest price at which each product can be sold. This will enable the e-commerce company to establish a pricing strategy that supports local artisans while offering discounts to their subscribers. The assignment provides an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with linear regression and its application in solving real-world challenges in the e-commerce industry.
